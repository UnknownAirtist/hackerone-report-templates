# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Vulnerability Report

## Summary

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was discovered in [AFFECTED COMPONENT/URL]. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authorization and access or modify data belonging to other users by manipulating object references.

**Vulnerability Type:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)  
**Severity:** [Critical/High/Medium]  
**CVSS Score:** [Score] ([Vector String])

## Description

I discovered that the application does not properly validate user authorization when accessing [RESOURCE TYPE] via the [ENDPOINT/FUNCTIONALITY]. By manipulating the [PARAMETER/ID/REFERENCE], an unauthorized user can access or modify resources belonging to other users.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Login with Account #1: [USER1_CREDENTIALS] (or create a test account)
2. Navigate to [URL/ENDPOINT]
3. Identify the [OBJECT REFERENCE] being used (e.g., `id=123`)
4. Login with Account #2: [USER2_CREDENTIALS] (or another test account)
5. Access the same functionality but replace the [OBJECT REFERENCE] with the one from Account #1
6. Observe that you can access/modify resources belonging to Account #1 despite being logged in as Account #2

## Proof of Concept

[INCLUDE SCREENSHOTS OR SCREEN RECORDING SHOWING THE EXPLOIT]

Here's a simple proof of concept that demonstrates the vulnerability:

1. [STEP 1 WITH SCREENSHOT - showing normal access with Account #1]
2. [STEP 2 WITH SCREENSHOT - showing the object reference in use]
3. [STEP 3 WITH SCREENSHOT - showing successful unauthorized access with Account #2]

## Technical Details

### Vulnerable Endpoint

- URL/API: [ENDPOINT]
- Method: [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE]
- Parameter/Reference: [PARAMETER NAME]

### Authorization Bypass Details

The system fails to validate whether the currently authenticated user has authorization to access the requested resource. When a resource identifier is manipulated, the application retrieves the requested resource without performing proper authorization checks.

## Impact

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could:

1. Access sensitive data belonging to other users
2. Modify information owned by other users
3. Delete other users' data
4. Perform unauthorized actions on behalf of other users
5. [ANY OTHER SPECIFIC IMPACTS RELEVANT TO THE TARGET APPLICATION]

## Affected Users/Resources

- All users with [SPECIFIC RESOURCE TYPE] are potentially affected
- [ANY SPECIFIC USER ROLES THAT ARE VULNERABLE]

## Mitigation Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, I recommend:

1. Implement proper authorization checks for all resource accesses
2. Use indirect reference maps instead of direct object references
3. Validate that the authenticated user has the right to access the requested resource
4. Consider implementing a contextual access control system
5. Implement proper logging and monitoring for access control failures
